Note: You need to get the [google-sevices.json](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase) and put it in your project's app folder.



Some code was inspired from:

  - [Android Push Notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging FCM & PHP](https://www.androidhive.info/2012/10/android-push-notifications-using-google-cloud-messaging-gcm-php-and-mysql/)
